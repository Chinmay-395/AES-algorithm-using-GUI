# AES-algorithm-using-GUI
Using pyAesCrypt library you can encrypt and decrypt a text using a function called encryptFile and decryptFile simultaneously.
In this particular code you can change the buffersize and password or take the same as an input from encrypter.

Steps:
1.Enter the text
2. click on sumbit --> This stores the output inside the a txt file called as data.txt
3. Click on Encrypt --> Which encrypts the text in a utf-8 type thereafter it stores the cipher text inside data.txt.aes file
4. Click on Decrypt --> The cipher text is decrypted and writen into dataout.txt
5. Click on output to see the same text inside the dataout.txt
